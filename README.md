### Hi there 👋, I'm Alex.

Above all else, I love learning new things, and there is certainly no shortage of that in the development world. I find it so satisfying to have a problem, research the solution, then be able to immediately apply my new knowledge to fix a problem I couldn't solve 5 minutes ago. I also dabble in 3D modeling, having completed a 65+ hour course in Blender. When not developing, I can be found playing trumpet in my community band, or frolicking in the snow.
