### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Healthcare worker turned web developer, I hold a B.S. in Health Sciences. Above all else, I love learning new things, and there is certainly no shortage of that in the development world. I am currently employed at Lambda School as a Team Lead.

I find it so satisfying to have a problem, research the solution, then be able to immediately apply my new knowledge to fix a problem I couldn't solve 5 minutes ago. I also dabble in 3D modeling, having completed a 65+ hour course in Blender. When not developing, I can be found playing trumpet in my community band, or frolicking in the snow.
